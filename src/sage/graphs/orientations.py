Orientations

This module implements several methods to compute orientations of undirected
graphs subject to specific constraints (e.g., acyclic, strongly connected,
etc.). It also implements some iterators over all these orientations.

def acyclic_orientations(G):
    r"""
    Return an iterator over all acyclic orientations of an undirected graph `G`.

    ALGORITHM:

    The algorithm is based on [Sq1998]_.
    It presents an efficient algorithm for listing the acyclic orientations of a
    graph. The algorithm is shown to require O(n) time per acyclic orientation
    generated, making it the most efficient known algorithm for generating acyclic
    orientations.

    The function uses a recursive approach to generate acyclic orientations of the
    graph. It reorders the vertices and edges of the graph, creating a new graph
    with updated labels. Then, it iteratively generates acyclic orientations by
    considering subsets of edges and checking whether they form upsets in a
    corresponding poset.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- an undirected graph.

    OUTPUT:

    - An iterator over all acyclic orientations of the input graph.

    .. NOTE::

        The function assumes that the input graph is undirected and the edges are unlabelled.

    EXAMPLES:

    To count number acyclic orientations for a graph::

        sage: g = Graph([(0, 3), (0, 4), (3, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)])
        sage: it = g.acyclic_orientations()
        sage: len(list(it))
        54

    Test for arbitary vertex labels::

        sage: g_str = Graph([('abc', 'def'), ('ghi', 'def'), ('xyz', 'abc'), ('xyz', 'uvw'), ('uvw', 'abc'), ('uvw', 'ghi')])
        sage: it = g_str.acyclic_orientations()
        sage: len(list(it))
        42

    TESTS:

    To count the number of acyclic orientations for a graph with 0 vertices::

        sage: list(Graph().acyclic_orientations())
        []

    To count the number of acyclic orientations for a graph with 1 vertex::

        sage: list(Graph(1).acyclic_orientations())
        []

    To count the number of acyclic orientations for a graph with 2 vertices::

        sage: list(Graph(2).acyclic_orientations())
        []

    Acyclic orientations of a complete graph::

        sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
        sage: it = g.acyclic_orientations()
        sage: len(list(it))
        120

    Graph with one edge::

        sage: list(Graph([(0, 1)]).acyclic_orientations())
        [Digraph on 2 vertices, Digraph on 2 vertices]

    Graph with two edges::

        sage: len(list(Graph([(0, 1), (1, 2)]).acyclic_orientations()))
        4

    Cycle graph::

        sage: len(list(Graph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]).acyclic_orientations()))

def strong_orientations_iterator(G):
    r"""
    Return an iterator over all strong orientations of a graph `G`.

    A strong orientation of a graph is an orientation of its edges such that the
    obtained digraph is strongly connected (i.e. there exist a directed path
    between each pair of vertices). According to Robbins' theorem (see the
    :wikipedia:`Robbins_theorem`), the graphs that have strong orientations are
    exactly the 2-edge-connected graphs (i.e., the bridgeless graphs).

    ALGORITHM:

    It is an adaptation of the algorithm published in [CGMRV16]_.
    It runs in `O(mn)` amortized time, where `m` is the number of edges and
    `n` is the number of vertices. The amortized time can be improved to `O(m)`
    with a more involved method.
    In this function, first the graph is preprocessed and a spanning tree is
    generated. Then every orientation of the non-tree edges of the graph can be
    extended to at least one new strong orientation by orienting properly
    the edges of the spanning tree (this property is proved in [CGMRV16]_).
    Therefore, this function generates all partial orientations of the non-tree
    edges and then launches a helper function corresponding to the generation
    algorithm described in [CGMRV16]_.
    In order to avoid trivial symmetries, the orientation of an arbitrary edge
    is fixed before the start of the enumeration process.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- an undirected graph.

    OUTPUT:

    - an iterator which will produce all strong orientations of this graph.

    .. NOTE::

        Works only for simple graphs (no multiple edges).
        To avoid symmetries an orientation of an arbitrary edge is fixed.

    EXAMPLES:

    A cycle has one possible (non-symmetric) strong orientation::

    Neither can be a disconnected graph::

        sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(6)

        ....:         b = False
        sage: b
        True

    The total number of strong orientations of a graph can be counted using
    the Tutte polynomial evaluated at points (0,2)::

        sage: nr1 = len(list(g.strong_orientations_iterator()))
